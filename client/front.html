      <h3>WHAT IS TEDX?</h3>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
            In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called TEDx. TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is called TEDxCapeTown, where x = independently organized TED event.
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
            At our TEDxCapeTown event, TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group.
            The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.
