    "description": "<p>I recently graduated from the Cape Peninsula University of Technology in Graphic Design. I am an enthusiastic 22 year old geared to making positive changes through design. The Eco Design Initiative changed my whole outlook on design. All that was taught to me about design being 'sell sell sell a product', has now changed to make 'change change change in people's lives'. Design is possibly the most powerful tool to change minds, lives and living. If Design thinking is just powered in the right direction, positive social upliftment and innovation could sprout up all over the world. It is the simple idea that is the most effective and what the Eco Design Initative Challenge taught me was the best way to get that simple idea is to involve those whom you designing for. Design for me used to be an inward perspective but it is now an outward approach. Design is not about the Designer, it is about the people whom you design for. Africa is the greatest place to begin to design for social upliftment and innovation. Africa is so rich in design, it just needs a little guidance in the right direction. </p> <p>   Africa is in me, it is in my home, it is in my community. I was not born in Africa neither am I a South African citizen but I have only ever known what it is to be African. Africa is my home, it is my teacher, it is who I am. Whenever I come home from traveling overseas and I see Table Mountain I know I am home. Hearing an African accent while overseas makes me feel close to home. Africa is a beat, a vibe, an energy that flows through every single on of us that live here. It is what connects us and makes us African. It is that connection that should fuel design in Africa. Design can eradicate that which was left by the colonial powers and the apartheid era if everyone is involved. Community is key in designing and if design had to focus on social upliftment and innovation with the involvement of the community one is designing for, then Africa could be a sustainable rich continent. The theme Africa in me relates to who I am, how I design and who I design with. I would like to share my experience with the Eco Design Initiative challenge as well as my own personal thoughts relating to the theme Africa in Me at TEDxYouth@CapeTown.</p>",

Healing and transformative - it is a powerful and useful tool. It is something worth celebrating, and something worth sharing. </p> <p>My idea worth spreading to present at TEDxCapeTown 2012 is that the process of creating poetry has certain principles that can be adapted into systems of living. Through the act of re-creating how we use language, we are able to re-create our very lives, we are able to reframe our experience of it. It offers us the opportunity to process and navigate the world differently. My talk is entitled 'The process is poetry / poetry is the process'.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Vivienne Schultz is an Ashoka fellow and has more than 16 years of field  experience in social entrepreneurship in collaboration with large  Multinational organisations.</p> <p>She will talk about getting unstuck:</p> <p>What causes humans to be stuck? “Stuckness”, i.e. not being able to move  forward in life is caused when a person experiences a life challenge,  but does not responding in a fruitful way. This in turn may be  incorrectly perceived as irresponsible behaviour by others. Becoming  valuable contributors to society can be achieved by growing Occupational  Intelligence or responsiveness in humans. <br /><br />As part of my journey  towards finding a solution to this challenge, I founded the A2B  Entrepreneurial Transformation Movement in South Africa.  I was  identified as a world change maker by the Ashoka Foundation in  Washington D.C. and subsequently my research was funded for a period of  three years. During this period I developed a methodology which measures  Occupational Intelligence in human beings. The A2B Scale of  Occupational Intelligence identifies  6 levels of Occupational  Intelligence responsiveness. With this scale the progress of humans can  be measured and achieved. Humans can progress from the lowest level of  the scale, A1, which is defined as being unconsciously incompetent to  B3, which is the highest level of the scale and described as altruistic  leadership. <br /><br />Understanding and practicing  the development of Occupational Intelligence is the missing puzzle  piece  for un-stucking humans. If  every educationalist, parent, skills  trainer and entrepreneurial developer all over the world can only be  trained to practice the science of Occupational Intelligence, our  world  will have much less stuck and irresponsible adults!</p>",

    "description": "<p>Mohammed holds an MBChB (Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery) from University of Stellenbosch. He is passionate about the impact of medicine within the rural context having completed his Community Service at Manguzi – a rural community – in the Maputaland region of the KwaZulu-Natal province. This led him to join MSF (Medecins Sans Frontieres – Doctors without Borders) as an ER doctor in various countries such as Pakistan, Libya and Syria. In 2012, the Mail &amp; Guardian recognized Mohammed as one of South Africa’s Top 200 young and most interesting people specifically for his groundbreaking work around the South African triage score and its implementation across the world. He is currently pursuing a PhD in Emergency Medicine at the University of Cape Town. In 2012 he co founded The Open Medicine Project, a non profit aimed at capacitating healthcare workers in the developing world using mobile technology. Their EM guidance app has been downloaded in over 145 countries and is being used by over 7000 health workers worldwide.  Mohammed believes in the accumulative value of individual contributions with the overall imperative of changing the world, one step at time</p>",

    "description": "<p>Masculinity is a profoundly beautiful gift to humanity. Wounded and  distorted masculinity however is a dreadful curse to humanity. Society  has rightly responded very negatively to the harm done by wounded men  with a misconstrued concept of masculinity. Sadly though much of the  response has done more to perpetuate the problem than solve it. We have  tried to tame men, re-invent men, feminize men, and vilify men. What we  really need though is not to reinvent masculinity but to rediscover it.  And enough men living with true masculinity will transform our world  into the safe, beautiful and exciting place it was always meant to be.</p>",
